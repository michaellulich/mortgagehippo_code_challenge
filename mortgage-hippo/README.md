This app was created for the Mortgage Hippo code challenge.

It uses Rails, and PostgreSQL, and the gem Figaro for keeping passwords secure.

I have the majority of the functionality that was required intact, however I ran into some roadblocks when configuring the mailer to email all the Admins with one outgoing email. Currently it only emails the Admin who is using the app. Also, I deployed it to Heroku but it contains some bugs in that regard. Some of the commits reflect attempting to solve these issues.

Thanks for your consideration!
